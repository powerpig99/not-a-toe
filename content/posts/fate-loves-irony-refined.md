# Fate Loves Irony: Production Creates Its Own Ideological Consumption

Jean-Baptiste Say observed that supply creates its own demand. In the era of collapsing marginal costs, the law finds its ironic fulfillment—not in goods, but in the conceptual systems that reinterpret them.

When production costs collapse—as AI now drives software toward zero marginal cost—output decouples from coordinated human effort. The surplus diffuses: unclaimed resources in wealth, capacity, and institutional attention flow outward. What happens next is not transformation but amplification.

Human activity projects onto many dimensions. One is production: generating results that pass direct tests of value through voluntary exchange or measurable consequence. Others include interpretation, normative construction, relational coordination, symbolic elaboration. Each has its own metric, its own optimization, its own logic of excellence. Each operates.

The key observation: orientations are modal and self-reinforcing. Under scarcity, the production dimension's feedback is tight—scarce resources constrain how far anyone extends along other axes. Abundance loosens the constraint. Orientations held in check now extend along their native vectors. Not new orientations. The same ones, amplified.

Here the mechanism turns. Each dimension generates its own feedback. The production dimension's signal is comparatively legible: output, exchange, measurable consequence. Those oriented primarily toward other dimensions receive a specific signal from the production axis—lower output, weaker recognition within that metric. This is what happens when you optimize along a different axis.

But signals from one dimension are interpreted through the logic of the dimension you inhabit. The production-axis signal gets read through interpretive or normative logic—and inverts. Lower standing in production becomes evidence of superiority along the home axis: greater moral sensitivity, deeper insight, refined critique. The inversion is internally coherent. Within the interpretive dimension's own metric, it may even be accurate. Civilization is richer for those who extend along these axes.

The inversion, on its own terms, is not where coherence breaks.

The fracture occurs at a precise location: the demand to convert claimed superiority in one dimension into rewards denominated in another. Excellence in interpretation does not register on the production axis. There is no exchange rate between orthogonal dimensions. Yet the move is made—demanding material support, institutional power, distributional priority as entitlements warranted by standing in interpretation, normative construction, or critique. One cannot coherently de-emphasize a dimension's discipline while claiming its outputs as a right justified by standing in a different dimension. The signal that might prompt honest pluralism—acknowledging that dimensions do not convert—is reframed as a warrant for extraction across the boundary.

The loop self-reinforces because the surplus enables it. The larger the surplus from the production core, the more viable the inversion, the more elaborate the conceptual systems justifying the cross-dimensional claim, the stronger the demand. Production funds the scaling of the frameworks that reinterpret production as the problem.

Say's observation finds its ironic echo. Hyper-production does not only create goods. It creates expanded demand for the conceptual systems that justify the inversion. These are not inventions of abundance. They are the natural extension of non-production orientations, amplified and rendered consequential because surplus makes their maintenance viable at scale.

When technology collapses cost in production, these systems face existential pressure: legible outcome-testing threatens to render the claimed superiority non-convertible. Resistance follows as self-preservation of the orientation. The frameworks casting production as suspect intensify precisely when production's legibility increases.

The structural irony: those generating abundance subsidize the expansion of the frameworks reinterpreting them as the source of the problem. Not through conspiracy—through surplus diffusion and modal self-reinforcement.

The loop has no exit because the belief in an exit is itself the loop's fuel. Every proposed solution—"dimensional honesty," "coherent claims," "better feedback"—is another conceptual product generated by the surplus, another extension along a non-production axis, another demand for cross-dimensional conversion. The corrective impulse and the thing it corrects run on the same engine.

This is neither tragedy nor comedy. It is how surplus propagates. Abundance amplifies what is already there. What is already there includes the impulse to narrate the amplification, to diagnose it, to prescribe. The prescription feeds back into the surplus. The loop tightens or loosens, but it does not resolve, because resolution would require standing outside the dimensions—and there is no outside.
