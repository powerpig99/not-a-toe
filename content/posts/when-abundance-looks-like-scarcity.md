# When Abundance Looks Like Scarcity

A well-constructed scenario imagines AI capability improving so fast that it triggers mass unemployment, mortgage defaults, private credit contagion, and a 38% market crash by mid-2028. The whole thing runs on one hidden move: hold the economic pie fixed, let AI accelerate inside it, and watch the displacement fall out mechanically.

## The Move

The piece treats the current set of economic activities as roughly the complete set. White-collar work is what it is today. Consumer spending patterns are what they are today. The mortgage market, the tax base, the labor market — all calibrated to the present.

Then it lets AI capability grow exponentially within that fixed space.

The result is arithmetic. If the pie doesn't grow but AI takes a larger slice, humans get a smaller one. Trace that through income, spending, credit, housing, tax receipts, and you get a crisis. You don't need 5,000 words of financial analysis to get there. You need the fixed-pie assumption and basic subtraction.

The 5,000 words serve a different purpose: they make the assumption invisible. When you're following the mechanics of ARR-backed loan defaults and insurance company capital requirements, you're not asking whether the pie is actually fixed. The complexity camouflages the simplicity.

## Why the Pie Isn't Fixed

Every efficiency gain in history has expanded the space of economic activity, not just reshuffled it.

The steam engine didn't divide a fixed amount of work between humans and machines. It made energy so cheap that entire industries became feasible — railways, factories, mass production — that didn't exist before. Total employment grew.

Computing didn't divide a fixed amount of calculation between humans and machines. It made computation so cheap that entirely new categories materialized — software, the internet, mobile, e-commerce. The demand for people who work with computers went up, not down, precisely because computers did most of the computing.

AI makes cognitive work cheaper. The replacement frame asks: who loses their slice? The expansion frame asks: what becomes feasible that wasn't before? These are different questions with different answers.

When building software costs nearly nothing, every organization, community, and individual becomes a potential creator. When analysis costs nearly nothing, decision quality improves everywhere. When translation, legal review, and financial planning cost nearly nothing, billions of people gain access to capabilities previously reserved for the few. Each expansion generates needs and activities that don't have names yet — just as "software engineer" had no name before computers existed.

The scenario can't see this because its frame excludes it. If you've already decided the pie is fixed, expansion is invisible by construction.

## What's Actually There

Dissolve the fixed-pie assumption and the scenario differentiates into three separate things:

**Transition friction.** Real. People lose high-paying jobs. Mortgages face stress. Sectors get disrupted. The speed is uneven and the pain is genuine. This deserves serious policy attention. It's a logistics problem, not an existential one.

**Distribution tension.** Real. Productivity gains tend to flow to capital before labor. This has been the trajectory for decades; AI accelerates it. The response is redistribution — taxing compute, direct transfers, public stakes in AI infrastructure. A policy problem, not a structural impossibility.

**Identity disorientation.** Real. "The U.S. is a white-collar services economy" is dissolving. It was an agricultural economy, then a manufacturing economy, then a services economy. Each transition felt like the end from inside. Each time, the economy was never the tasks. It was the organizing. The tasks were the bottleneck. Remove the bottleneck and the organizing continues.

Each of these is genuine. Each operates independently. Each has its own response. The "crisis" appears only when you collapse all three onto one axis and hold the pie fixed.

## The Pattern

This is the same structure that operates at the individual level. "Will AI take my job?" holds the job fixed and lets AI grow — guaranteed displacement. "Will AI expand what I can do?" lets both move — different question, different answer.

The macro version just scales it up. "Will AI take the economy?" holds the economy fixed. "Will AI expand what the economy does?" lets both move.

The scenario chose the first framing, traced it with rigor, and presented the derivation as discovery. The sophistication is real. The foundation is a choice.
