# Reality Doesn't Invoice by Committee

The most accurate language for capacity is action, but it is only visible when it moves. Diplomacy is a different language — one that can describe capacity or substitute for it, and the two are indistinguishable until someone moves. This mechanism runs through geopolitics, institutional culture, and individual self-understanding. It is a single error producing predictable distortions wherever it operates.

## The Line

Diplomacy is the explanations you need for power and the excuses for the lack of it.

That line landed on a viral thread about Trump's capture of Maduro and the decapitation strike on Iran's top leadership — two operations, two nights, decades of multilateral process rendered ornamental. The thread included photos of European leaders mid-shock: von der Leyen, Macron, the full cast. But the line isn't about foreign policy. Foreign policy is just where the mechanism is most visible.

## Projection Collapse

Two dimensions are in play: linguistic competence and operative capacity. Both project onto a single observable — institutional activity. The conference room is full either way. The statements get issued. The votes are cast. Whether anything operative sits underneath is invisible until someone moves.

This is a projection collapse. Two orthogonal axes — what you can describe and what you can do — crammed onto one coordinate. The result is spurious correlation: fluency registers as function. The collapse produces three downstream effects.

**The capable stop maintaining capacity.** If the language of power registers as the thing itself, attending to the language feels like attending to the thing. You hold the meetings, draft the frameworks, issue the joint communiqués — and the machinery underneath rusts. Not because the language caused the decay, but because fluency in description displaced the discipline of operation. Europe's diplomatic tradition is a sophisticated language for a capacity that has been slowly hollowed out by the sophistication of the language itself. The description ate the described.

**The capable defer to the language.** This isn't the actor who moved — that actor demonstrated the capacity directly. This is the decades before: US administrations that held operative capacity but increasingly registered diplomatic alignment as the capacity itself. The language-layer said power lives in coalition, in process, in multilateral consensus — and the capable actor, fluent in that register, deferred. Not because the capacity had decayed, but because the projection collapsed: alignment-as-described registered as power-as-held. Self-doubt enters not through failure but through fluency. You *can* move, but the approved register says moving without narration isn't real moving, so you wait for the language to authorize what the capacity already permits.

**The incapable register as capable.** Master the language without the capacity and the substitution is complete. The EU Parliament in full session, hands raised, voting on their official position about an event that landed weeks ago. They are not deciding outcomes. They are deciding the shared story so the bill can be split. The vote is real activity — real effort, real coordination, real institutional weight — substituting for the one thing that would make it unnecessary: having already moved.

## The Recursion

The original thread argued over whether Trump's moves were "unilateral." But unilateralism or not is just framing. The cut underneath:

*It is always unilateral in that you are always responsible, fully, for what happens to you. It is never unilateral in the sense it's never fully dependent on what you do, especially not depending on what you expect from your actions.*

Full ownership. Non-full control over outcomes. Not two claims in tension — the ground that's left when you strip the narrative layer entirely.

The projection collapse operates recursively. The debate over "unilateral vs. multilateral" is itself the mechanism in action — two positions competing on the language axis while the operative axis goes unexamined. Was the action effective? Did it achieve its strategic objectives? Those questions don't register in the frame because the frame is built from language-competence coordinates, not operative ones. The debate about the move substitutes for examining the move. The map argues about itself while the territory has already shifted.

This recursion has no natural exit. Every attempt to narrate the collapse is more narration. Every framework for seeing the substitution is another layer of language. The only thing that breaks the loop is the same thing that exposed it: someone moves, and the language-layer discovers it was describing nothing.

## Dissolution

The dissolution isn't "diplomacy bad, action good." That's another collapse — forcing two projections back onto one evaluative axis. Language for capacity is necessary. Maps are necessary. The pathology is specific: it's the moment the map is taken for the territory and the territory is left unattended because the map looks complete.

The corrective doesn't parse as a rule ("stop mistaking fluency for function"). A rule is more language-layer, and is subject to the same substitution. What dissolves the collapse is seeing where the dimensions have been forced to share coordinates they don't share. Once you stop trying to make one projection do the work of another, each operates without interference. The conference still meets. The statement still issues. But somewhere, someone has to have already moved — or the language is describing nothing, and no one in the room can tell.

Reality already invoiced the actor who moved. No committee, no meeting, no vote changes that ledger. Capacity spoke in the only language it has — action — and the action was visible because it moved. The only question left is whether the language you're speaking describes a capacity that exists, or has quietly replaced it.
