# On Education, Resonance, and Giving Someone the Real Thing

A friend from years ago reached out after 5+ years of silence. She runs a WeChat channel called 美教投—American Education and Investment—and has positioned herself as an expert in getting kids into prestigious western universities. She wanted me to share insights about Finnish education.

The minute I agreed, she started fitting me into a slot. Profile, structured topics, deliverables. I realized immediately: there's no way I can help her or her audience, because they're looking for something they're already familiar with. So I refused. She pushed. Eventually she framed it as a personal favor—"for the sake of helping me"—while showing zero interest in where I actually stand on any of this.

I'd been thinking about education anyway, and this is what crystallized.

## The paradox of optimization

教育的对象是人，人是有自由有意识的，也就不可能完全被外界塑造。

The object of education is a person. A person has freedom and consciousness—which means they can never be fully shaped from the outside.

This sounds obvious, but follow the implication: the more systematically you optimize education, the more you treat the child as an object to be shaped. Which contradicts the very thing that makes education meaningful—that the child is a subject with their own agency. **The optimization itself becomes the constraint.**

越是有效的教育方式，越是限制孩子的潜力。越是追求教育方式的家长，越可能成为孩子成长的限制。

The more "effective" the method, the more it limits the child's potential. The more a parent pursues the right method, the more likely they become the ceiling.

I've tried every approach. Read countless books. Every method that seemed to work came with larger side effects. And even with just two kids in the same household, the same method never works the same way. Because the causal weight lives inside the child, not in the method. The method is a minor perturbation on a self-organizing system.

Each new book gives you a new lens—which gives you a new way to see the child as deficient relative to the lens. More frameworks = more perceived gaps = more interventions = less space.

而一旦有了向外输出的欲望就更要命，那就变成了锤子，看啥都是钉子。

And once you develop the desire to output—to share your parenting wisdom, to advise others, to build an identity around "I figured this out"—you become a hammer, and everything looks like a nail.

## The pattern in practice

Which brings me back to my friend.

She *is* the pattern. Her channel, her audience, her brand—all built on the premise that education is a solvable optimization problem. The entire business model requires that premise to hold.

So when she reached out, she didn't need *me*. She needed a component: "Jing, Finland-based education perspective." Content asset, not person. The 5-year silence followed by immediate formatting requests says it all.

I actually did open up. I sent her a summary of my past 60 days—more than 900 long posts distilled by my digital twin. My actual thinking, my actual trajectory. She didn't read it. Not because it was too much. Because it wasn't in the shape she needed. It wasn't a bio and three bullet points. It was me, and she didn't ask for me. She asked for a deliverable.

你给了她真的，她要的是假的。

You gave her the real thing. What she wanted was the fake version.

## The resonance gap

This generalizes. Most requests for "authenticity" are actually requests for a *performable version* of authenticity. Shaped like honesty, but pre-digested for consumption.

And the resonance gap between us isn't because people change. It's because the original connection was thinner than either of us believed. Shared context masked the divergence. Remove the context, add time, and you see what was always there—the overlap was situational, not structural.

不是圈子小了，是看清了。

The circle didn't shrink. You just see clearly now.

Someone might call that a cost—fewer connections, less reach, smaller audience. But that framing still operates within the game, as if connection-quantity is the currency. What actually happens is you stop losing energy to connections that were never producing anything real. Every shallow connection carries maintenance overhead: the performance, the compression, the fitting-yourself-into-their-frame. Dropping it isn't isolation. It's the removal of friction.

## Dissolving the desire for an approach

The deepest version of the education insight might be this: the optimal approach is to dissolve the desire to have an approach. Not out of neglect, but because the dissolution is what creates space. A child needs a parent who is present, responsive, and genuinely uncertain about what they'll become. Uncertainty isn't a failure mode. It's the operating condition.

Same with sharing ideas. I'm always willing to share—but only if it resonates. Resonance means the other person is already moving in a direction where what you say can land. You're not filtering for agreement. You're filtering for receptivity to the actual shape of the idea.

The compression works when it emerges from clarity, not when you force content into a format. 她要的是后者。She wanted the latter.

So this is me not compressing. Leaving the full shape here. If it resonates, it resonates. If not, that's also information.
