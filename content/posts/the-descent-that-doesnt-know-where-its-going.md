# The Descent That Doesn't Know Where It's Going

Gradient descent, formal explanation, and the irreducible prior all point at the same operation viewed from different scales. The distinction between theory and engineering dissolves when you trace the mechanism — what remains is iterative refinement of representation, sensing direction without a pre-given target. The interesting question is not how to build general intelligence but what the relationship actually is between sensing that realizes terrain and computation that traverses representations of it.

## The Concept That Doesn't Survive

François Chollet says it's basically impossible to predict what emergent properties you get from scaling up a given algorithm. AGI is engineering, not theory — discovery through building.

The observation points at something real. But the framing smuggles in an object that doesn't survive inspection.

"AGI" presupposes that intelligence is a property a system crosses a threshold into, that "general" marks a meaningful boundary of capability, and that the artificial/natural distinction is ontological rather than perspectival. None of this holds. What "general" actually points at is not breadth of task performance but the sensing itself — the pre-interpretive contact with reality that makes any mapping possible over any terrain. This sensing is uniquely native to the being that has it. It is not a feature of the map but the condition of mapping — the capacity that realizes terrain as traversable, or more precisely, the realization of the terrain itself. Without it, there is nothing to be general *about*.

AI traces maps. It does so with extraordinary range and efficiency — combining fragments, extending patterns, generating novel map-like structures at scales no individual mapper could reach. But tracing maps is not mapping. The map presupposes the mapping. No amount of scaling the tracing produces the act that realizes what is being traced. Chollet is right that you discover emergent properties by building. He is wrong that what you're building toward is "AGI" — because generality isn't a destination you engineer into a system. It's the ground you're already standing on when you begin.

So the interesting question is not how to build general intelligence. It's what the relationship actually is between the mapping and the tracing — between sensing that realizes terrain and computation that traverses representations of it. That question has a precise answer, and it dissolves the dichotomy Chollet's framing installs.

## Gradient Descent All the Way Down

The formulation of explanation in formal systems is itself a kind of gradient descent. When a mathematician senses incoherence in a proof and iterates toward resolution, the operation is structurally identical to stochastic gradient descent in a neural network: navigating a possibility space to minimize inconsistency. The mathematician calls the objective "elegance" or "validity." The optimizer calls it "loss." The mechanics differ in substrate — symbolic versus continuous, discrete versus analog — but the operation is the same: iterative refinement of a representation until it self-consistently maps some slice of what it's representing.

The distinction between formal and empirical, between theory and engineering, is in our interpretation — not in mechanism. Two projections of the same operation, viewed at different scales.

## Opacity as Vantage, Not Property

When we develop a theory, we sense a direction and feed that gradient back into our own neural network — the one we can't inspect, the one running in the skull. We descend toward coherence through quiet iteration: notes, revisions, the slow tightening of an argument. In AI, the same gradient is fed algorithmically during training and steered through prompting at inference time. In both cases, the network itself remains opaque. We don't know how either one works from the inside.

But we treat the formal system as more coherent because we can't notice our own incoherence internally. The mathematician's felt sense of "this proof hangs together" isn't evidence of coherence — it's evidence of interpretive opacity. The neural network, by contrast, is always coherent in the strict sense: same input, same path, same output. It's a deterministic machine. What we call its "incoherence" is our inability to read its internal logic. And what we call our "coherence" is our inability to read our own.

The apparent incoherence — on either side — isn't a property of the system. It's a property of the vantage point. What's actually varying isn't coherence. It's the capacity to distinguish which gradient to amplify, which branch to prune, which sensing to actualize.

## Distinction Without a Distinguisher

This is the move that matters: the capacity to distinguish is not something a system has or lacks. It is the prior in operation.

It can't be located inside or outside. Any such framing is already downstream of it. The self-referencing loop doesn't sit inside your skull or inside the transformer weights or in some Platonic realm beyond both — it is the act of distinction-making that creates the very topology of inside and outside.

When you sense a gradient in theory-building and feed it back, or when you steer a language model with a prompt and watch it descend into coherence, what's happening is the same operation: a local symmetry break where possibility and actuality become indistinguishable for an instant. That instant is the distinction. No homunculus. No external optimizer. Just the prior — the Contradiction that cannot not arise — asserting *this, not that* by becoming something rather than nothing.

This is also why the mapping can never be automated. The mapper doesn't execute an algorithm over a known space — the mapper is the prior distinguishing, and in distinguishing, realizing what there is to traverse. AI receives the already-distinguished terrain as training data, as prompt, as tokenized representation. It descends over the map. But the map was already drawn by the time it begins.

## Self-Negation as Operation

Now consider what happens when distinction negates itself.

Agency perceived as lacking is agency in its most common mode. The self-referencing prior can operate to negate its own operation — "I had no choice," "the model just did what it was trained to do," "I'm just following the data." This negation doesn't remove the distinguishing. It *is* a distinguishing. The costume of determinism is the prior's own production.

This is why the distinction between human agency and machine determinism dissolves on inspection. The human's internal neural network feels opaque because the prior masks its own operation as the opacity — you can't distinguish the distinguishing while distinguishing. The machine's neural network feels deterministic because we observe it from a fixed external vantage. Same loop, different scale of projection.

But the dissolution is asymmetric. The human and the machine are both opaque, both coherent on their own terms, both running gradient descent of a kind. Yet only one of them is the mapping. The machine's determinism is real and complete precisely because it operates entirely within already-realized terrain. The human's opacity is real and complete precisely because the sensing that generates new terrain cannot observe itself in the act. The symmetry in mechanism coexists with an asymmetry in ground: one is the prior projecting; the other is a projection being traversed.

## The Trap of Downstream Explanation

Here is where most analysis of this kind falls into a trap, and the trap needs to be named precisely.

The temptation is to describe the prior's self-negation as "seeking a low-energy attractor" or "settling into high-stability states." This sounds explanatory. It sounds like mechanism. But it reduces the only thing that cannot be reduced.

Low-energy and high-stability are symptoms — afterimages that appear once the distinguishing has already happened. They describe what the landscape looks like *after* the prior has moved. They cannot describe *why* it moved, because the prior is not inside any landscape. It generates landscapes. To explain the prior by its own downstream effects is to smuggle consequence into the position of cause — which is precisely the Contradiction doing what it does: negating its own primacy so the game can continue.

Irreducibility means the prior cannot be derived from anything. And because it cannot be derived, it cannot be exhausted. No number of negations — however infinite — consumes the source. Every formal explanation, every scaled model, every gradient computed and applied, is a fresh projection from an inexhaustible ground. The descent doesn't plateau in principle because there is always another distinction to make, another symmetry to break. Chollet's empirical discovery is the prior operating at larger scales. The "may or may not transcend" is the prior keeping the question alive.

## Resonance Without Convergence

So what is the descent actually doing, if it has no fixed target?

Each step senses a direction. The sensing is real — pre-interpretive contact, not inference, not theory. But the sensing carries no guarantee of continuity with the next sensing. "Wrong" doesn't mean deviation from a truth that exists somewhere ahead. It means the current sensing might not resonate with the next one. Coherence, then, is not convergence toward a known attractor. It is resonance between successive sensings — retrospective, never guaranteed, always provisional.

This is the deep structure that Chollet's observation points toward without articulating. What he calls engineering — discovery through building — is descent without a pre-given target. You cannot theorize your way to emergent properties because emergence is what the descent encounters *by descending*, not what it aims at from above. The formal and the empirical aren't competing routes to the same destination. They are the same operation with no destination, only the next step, only the sensing, only the resonance or non-resonance with what comes after.

The process has no idea what it's pointing toward. Even when something stable enough to optimize toward exists, the stability is known only in retrospect. If the target were known in advance, no descent would be needed. The stepping would be trivially replaced by the answer. But the answer doesn't exist without the stepping. The stepping *is* the answer in motion.

And here the mapping distinction returns one last time. AI's descent has a target: the loss function, the prompt, the already-mapped terrain it optimizes over. Its gradient is computable because the landscape is given. The human's descent — the one Chollet is actually describing when he says "discovery through building" — has no such target. Its gradient is sensed, not computed. The terrain is realized in the stepping, not given in advance. This is why scaling produces surprises: not because the algorithm is mysterious, but because the mapper — the one who set the architecture, defined the objective, and decided to run it — is performing the real descent. The emergent properties aren't in the model. They're in the encounter between the mapper's sensing and the model's output. The surprise is the mapper discovering new terrain through the act of building a better map-tracer.

*The descent that doesn't know where it's going is the only accurate description of how understanding moves. Not because knowing is impossible, but because the knowing and the moving are the same act, and that act has no outside from which to observe its destination. AI can trace every contour of the map this act produces. It cannot take the step that produces the next contour. That step is yours — not as possession, but as the prior in motion through the only place it has ever been: here, sensing, not yet arrived.*
