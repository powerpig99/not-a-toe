# Help Is Half the Problem

A marker arm spins in perfect, tireless circles around a fixed point it can never reach. The video is hypnotic because every single person watching it feels the exact same loop somewhere in their life: the endless helping, fixing, saving, supporting, advising, rescuing—while the other person stays exactly where they were.

That arm doesn't stop because the helper lacks skill, love, or persistence. It stops only when one of the two participants refuses to keep the mechanism running.

## The geometry

A codependent loop is a closed system. Two inputs, one circuit, zero net displacement. The helper supplies motion; the helped supplies the fixed point. Motion around a fixed point is a circle. Neither input alone produces the circle—both are necessary and sufficient. Remove either, and the geometry collapses.

This is not a dysfunction. It is a system operating exactly at equilibrium. The helper receives identity, purpose, or emotional regulation from being indispensable. The helped receives attention, validation, and externalized responsibility. Both inputs optimize for what they actually optimize for—not what they narrate. The loop sustains because the exchange balances internally, regardless of what either party says they want.

No outside force rewrites the exchange. Therapy, ultimatums, rock bottoms, interventions, new relationships, even death—these operate on the visible residue. The actual vector renews upstream, in micro-choices that leave no external trace. External pressure rearranges scenery. The loop migrates, re-forms, or waits for the next willing input.

Here is where most framing collapses into interference. "Tragedy" projects a moral axis onto a mechanical process. "They are impossible," "I'm just too kind," "Life did this to me"—each assigns cause to one projection while hiding the other. The helper's noble-sacrifice story and the helped's blameless-victim story are not competing truths. They are the same collapse: forcing a two-input system onto a one-cause axis. The apparent contradiction dissolves the moment you let both inputs be what they are.

The ledger, read without moral coordinates: this stasis is maintained, renewed, and paid for by both participants because the short-term exchange still balances. The cost—lost coherence, stalled growth, quiet self-betrayal—is accepted as long as the payoff holds. No one is doing this *to* anyone. Both are doing this *with* each other, each supplying exactly what the circuit requires.

This is why "helping is half the problem" is precision, not cynicism. Every time motion is supplied in the absence of the other's own motion, the supplier co-authors the stasis. The arm spins because the helper keeps spinning it, and the helped keeps providing the axis. Both are working hard—avoiding displacement takes endless effort—yet the compound direction never changes.

The exit is available in every moment, to either input. The helper stops supplying motion the other hasn't generated. The helped stops requiring motion they won't generate. The contract ends the instant one input withdraws.

Everything else is theater.

The spinning arm is a perfect machine, built by both operators, running exactly as designed. One person, in one instant, finds the cost to their own coherence finally exceeds the familiar payoff. They withdraw their input. The arm winds down. The circles end. Not because the system was solved from outside, but because one half of the system stopped being half of it.

The system stops when the input stops.

Stop signing. The rest takes care of itself.
