# The Interesting Case of Rubin

Rick Rubin tells you to make things for fun. Not for anyone else. No stakes, no consequences, only for yourself. It's good advice. It also contains a contradiction he can't escape—not because he's a fraud, but because the advice itself has a structural problem.

## The Fun That Can't Be Aimed At

The fun Rubin describes isn't a goal you can pursue. It's a byproduct of a particular relationship to the work—one where external judgment is absent, where the making *is* the point. The moment you frame "make things for fun" as an instruction, you've already introduced teleology: *I should try to have fun.* Which is precisely the orientation that kills it.

Fun, in the sense Rubin means it, is what happens when you're not optimizing for anything—including fun. It's the residue of unmediated engagement. You can't chase a residue.

## The Preacher's Trap

This is where Rubin's position becomes structurally interesting. He has built an identity—books, podcasts, interviews—around articulating the principle that creative work should be free of external validation. But articulating a principle *to an audience* is itself an act oriented toward reception. The insight about internality gets externalized in the very act of sharing it.

This isn't hypocrisy. It's a trap built into the geometry of the situation. The moment an insight about *not performing* becomes something you deliver to others, you are performing it. The mindfulness guru attached to being seen as unattached. The authenticity influencer whose brand *is* authenticity. Rubin, telling millions of people to stop caring what millions of people think.

The more successfully you preach it, the more your identity becomes "the person who teaches this." Your relationship to the insight is now mediated by exactly the external validation loop the insight warns against.

## What Gets Transferred

There's a deeper problem: wisdom of this kind may be fundamentally non-transferable. The people who can hear "the fun lies in the making, not as a goal" and understand it are already the ones who make things that way. They don't need the advice. The people who need it will interpret it as an instruction—*get in the habit of having fun*—which is the misattribution the advice was supposed to correct.

The sentence is a compression artifact. Rubin compressed a lifetime of creative practice into a phrase. But decompression requires the context that produced the compression. Without it, the reader fills in their own context—which is the wrong one, or they wouldn't need the advice.

This is the economy of wisdom: it circulates most freely among those who already possess it. The wise enjoy producing it. The audience enjoys consuming it. But what gets transferred in the transaction is the *form* of the insight, not the *state* it describes.

## The Recursive Trap

And here the irony completes itself. The real value of wisdom to the wise is the fun they have in producing it—the same unmediated engagement Rubin describes. But the fame that follows the production gradually reorients attention from the making to the reception. The reward signal is subtle: it feels like validation of the process, so the producer doesn't notice the mode shift. They think they're still in the same state. But the audience has become a phantom presence in the workshop. "Only for yourself" has quietly become "for the version of myself that gets recognized for saying 'only for yourself.'"

The very success of communicating the insight degrades the condition that produced it.

## Still More Alive Than Most

None of this makes Rubin wrong, and it doesn't make his work empty. He is still operating closer to what he describes than almost anyone offering creative advice. The contradiction is real, but it's a matter of degree—the signal is degraded, not destroyed. He clearly still *makes* things from a place most people never access.

But the preaching is undeniable, and it does diminish it. Not as a moral failing, but as a structural inevitability. The act of turning inward practice into outward teaching introduces exactly the distortion the teaching warns against. It's a cost built into the act of sharing.

The only transmission that wouldn't carry this cost is the one that isn't trying to transmit—the work itself, encountered without instruction, speaking through its own aliveness rather than through an explanation of how it was made.
